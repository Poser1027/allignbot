## Introduction:  
This is a class project of ECE470 Introduction to Robotics, 21fall UIUC.

In the practical application of conveyor belt, object posture adjustment and object sorting have always been primary tasks. In our project, we seek to find a way to implement UR3 robot arm in object sorting with random size and pose. The method should be able to detect the size of different objects to sort them into a small size group and a bigger size group. Then, with objects in arbitrary position, the bot should be able to detect the posture of each object and align them according to the requirements of the next operation process. Only one UR robot will be used for achieving both functions.   
 
 
Our project will be using ROS on Ubuntu for the main software. The virtual machine file is provided by the class instructor, which contains ROS and the basic URDF model other critical files for the gazebo simulation. Our design will be based on those resources.
