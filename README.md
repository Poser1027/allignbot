## Introduction:
In the practical application of conveyor belt, object posture adjustment and object sorting have always been primary tasks. In our project, we seek to find a way to implement UR3 robot arm in object sorting with random size and pose. The method should be able to detect the size of different objects to sort them into a small size group and a bigger size group. Then, with objects in arbitrary position, the bot should be able to detect the posture of each object and align them according to the requirements of the next operation process. Only one UR robot will be used for achieving both functions. 

## Main challenges:
The first challenge will be detecting the size of each object, and sorting them into two categories for different conveyors. The second would be detecting the position and using robot kinematics to align them according to requirement. These processes will need some computer vision background for coding, and robot control method for sorting and posture adjustment.
